# BigRedButton
An application for use over a LAN. There is a Big Red Button on one computer (preferably touchscreen)  which when clicked, will buzz all other comupters which have connected to the big red button. The "admin" computers (the clients to the BRG) have the ability to remotely show and hide the button, as well as the ability to remotely shutdown the BRG server.
